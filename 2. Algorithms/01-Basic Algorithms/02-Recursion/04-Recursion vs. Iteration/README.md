# Recursion vs. Iteration: A Detailed Comparison

## Fundamental Differences

**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

**Iteration** uses looping constructs (like for, while, do-while) to repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition is met.

## Key Differences

### 1. Approach to Problem Solving

- **Recursion**: Follows a "divide and conquer" approach - breaks problem into smaller instances of itself
- **Iteration**: Uses repetition - executes the same code block multiple times with changing state

### 2. Control Flow

- **Recursion**: Implicit control flow through function calls and the call stack
- **Iteration**: Explicit control flow through loop conditions and counters

### 3. Termination Condition

- **Recursion**: Base case(s) stop the recursion
- **Iteration**: Loop condition stops the iteration

### 4. Memory Usage

- **Recursion**: Uses call stack, potentially leading to stack overflow for deep recursion
- **Iteration**: Generally uses constant memory (just variables)

### 5. Performance

- **Recursion**: Function call overhead (stack frame creation/cleanup)
- **Iteration**: Typically more efficient as it avoids function call overhead

## When to Use Each

### Use Recursion When

- The problem naturally fits a recursive definition (e.g., tree traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms)
- The solution is more elegant and readable in recursive form
- The depth of recursion is manageable and won't cause stack overflow

### Use Iteration When

- Performance is critical and stack overflow is a concern
- The problem can be easily expressed with loops
- You need fine-grained control over the execution flow

## üîÅ Iteration vs. üåÄ Recursion: What's the Difference?

| Feature              | Recursion                                    | Iteration                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | A function that calls itself                 | A loop (e.g., `for` or `while`)          |
| **Control Flow**     | Function calls itself repeatedly             | Repeats a block of code using loops      |
| **Termination**      | Base case ends the recursive calls           | Loop ends with a condition               |
| **Memory Usage**     | Uses call stack (extra memory)               | Uses constant memory                     |
| **Speed**            | Slower due to overhead of function calls     | Faster due to no function call overhead  |
| **Best Use Case**    | Naturally recursive problems (trees, graphs) | Linear tasks (searching, counting, etc.) |

## üî¢ Example: Factorial of a Number

### 1. **Recursive Version**

```python
def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
```

üîç **Explanation**:

- Calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches `1`
- `factorial_recursive(5)` calls `factorial_recursive(4)` ‚Ä¶ until `factorial_recursive(1)` returns `1`

üß† **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
üì¶ **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` (due to call stack)

---

### 2. **Iterative Version**

```python
def factorial_iterative(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

üîç **Explanation**:

- Uses a `for` loop from `2` to `n`
- Multiplies result step by step

üß† **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
üì¶ **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (constant space)

---

## üßÆ Another Example: Fibonacci Numbers

### Recursive Version

```python
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
```

üß† **Time Complexity**: `O(2^n)` ‚Äî very inefficient due to repeated calculations  
üì¶ **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` ‚Äî max depth of the recursion tree

---

### Iterative Version

```python
def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n+1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

üß† **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
üì¶ **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

## üö® When to Use Recursion vs Iteration?

### ‚úÖ Use **Recursion** When

- The problem is naturally recursive (e.g., **tree traversal**, **DFS**, **combinations**, etc.)
- It simplifies code logic (though may need optimization)

### ‚úÖ Use **Iteration** When

- You want **better performance** and **less memory**
- The problem doesn‚Äôt need stack-based memory
- You need to avoid **stack overflow** for large input sizes

## üöÄ Optimizing Recursion: Memoization

Recursive Fibonacci is slow. Add **memoization** to make it efficient:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci_memo(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci_memo(n-1) + fibonacci_memo(n-2)
```

üß† Time Complexity with memo: `O(n)`  
üì¶ Space Complexity: `O(n)` (for cache and recursion stack)
