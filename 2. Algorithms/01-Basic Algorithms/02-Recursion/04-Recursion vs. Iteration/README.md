# Recursion vs. Iteration: A Detailed Comparison

## Fundamental Differences

**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

**Iteration** uses looping constructs (like for, while, do-while) to repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition is met.

## Key Differences

### 1. Approach to Problem Solving

- **Recursion**: Follows a "divide and conquer" approach - breaks problem into smaller instances of itself
- **Iteration**: Uses repetition - executes the same code block multiple times with changing state

### 2. Control Flow

- **Recursion**: Implicit control flow through function calls and the call stack
- **Iteration**: Explicit control flow through loop conditions and counters

### 3. Termination Condition

- **Recursion**: Base case(s) stop the recursion
- **Iteration**: Loop condition stops the iteration

### 4. Memory Usage

- **Recursion**: Uses call stack, potentially leading to stack overflow for deep recursion
- **Iteration**: Generally uses constant memory (just variables)

### 5. Performance

- **Recursion**: Function call overhead (stack frame creation/cleanup)
- **Iteration**: Typically more efficient as it avoids function call overhead

## When to Use Each

### Use Recursion When

- The problem naturally fits a recursive definition (e.g., tree traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms)
- The solution is more elegant and readable in recursive form
- The depth of recursion is manageable and won't cause stack overflow

### Use Iteration When

- Performance is critical and stack overflow is a concern
- The problem can be easily expressed with loops
- You need fine-grained control over the execution flow
