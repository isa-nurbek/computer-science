## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Let's analyze the **time and space complexity** of the **Aho-Corasick algorithm**, which is particularly efficient for
**multi-pattern string matching**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Let‚Äôs define some variables:**
- `n` = length of the **text**.
- `m` = total length of all **patterns** combined.
- `k` = number of **patterns**.
- `œÉ` = size of the **alphabet** (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters).

---

## üîß Build Phase

### 1. `build_trie(patterns)`
- Every character in every pattern is inserted once into the trie.
- **Time complexity:** `O(m)` (each character in the patterns is processed once).
- **Space complexity:** `O(m)` (in worst-case, each character creates a new node).

---

### 2. `build_failure_links()`
- BFS traversal of the trie, setting fail links.
- Each node has at most `œÉ` children.
- For each node and each child, the failure link is found by traversing up at most `log(m)` times in practice,
but amortized constant time using efficient fail links.

- **Time complexity:** `O(m)` (since each node and edge is visited once).
- **Space complexity:** `O(m)` (queue size and failure links).

---

## üîç Search Phase: `search(text)`
- Traverse the text once, following trie edges and fail links.
- For each character in the text:
  - In the worst case, we might follow several fail links (though amortized time per character is **O(1)**).
- When we land on a node with output, we collect matches (which may be many).
- **Time complexity:** `O(n + z)`  
  - `n` for scanning the text,  
  - `z` for total number of matches found.
- **Space complexity:** `O(z)` for storing matches.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Phase                 | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity  |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `build_trie`          | O(m)             | O(m)              |
| `build_failure_links` | O(m)             | O(m)              |
| `search`              | O(n + z)         | O(z)              |
| **Total**             | **O(m + n + z)** | **O(m + z)**      |
