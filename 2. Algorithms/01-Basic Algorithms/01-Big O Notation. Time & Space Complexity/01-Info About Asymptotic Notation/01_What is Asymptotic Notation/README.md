# **Asymptotic Notation**

## **Introduction**
Asymptotic notation is a mathematical framework used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time complexity and space complexity as the input size (\( n \)) grows. It provides a way to compare algorithms based on their performance without worrying about machine-specific details, such as processor speed or compiler optimizations.

---

## **Why Asymptotic Notation?**
- **Focus on Growth Rate** â€“ Analyzes how runtime scales with increasing input size.
- **Machine Independence** â€“ Ignores constant factors and lower-order terms.
- **Comparative Analysis** â€“ Helps determine which algorithm performs better for large inputs.

---

## **Types of Asymptotic Notation**
### **1. Big-O Notation (\( O \)) â€“ Upper Bound**
Big-O notation gives an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm. It describes the worst-case scenario.

#### **Mathematical Definition**
A function \( f(n) \) is said to be **O(g(n))** if there exist positive constants \( c \) and \( n_0 \) such that:

\[
f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n) \quad \forall n \geq n_0
\]

#### **Example**
For an algorithm that takes \( 3n^2 + 5n + 7 \) operations:

\[
O(n^2)
\]

because \( n^2 \) dominates for large \( n \).

---

### **2. Omega Notation (\( \Omega \)) â€“ Lower Bound**
Omega notation provides a lower bound on the running time of an algorithm, describing the best-case scenario.

#### **Mathematical Definition**
A function \( f(n) \) is said to be **Î©(g(n))** if there exist positive constants \( c \) and \( n_0 \) such that:

\[
f(n) \geq c \cdot g(n) \quad \forall n \geq n_0
\]

#### **Example**
For \( f(n) = 3n^2 + 5n + 7 \):

\[
\Omega(n^2)
\]

---

### **3. Theta Notation (\( \Theta \)) â€“ Tight Bound**
Theta notation provides both upper and lower bounds, meaning it describes the exact order of growth.

#### **Mathematical Definition**
A function \( f(n) \) is **Î˜(g(n))** if there exist positive constants \( c_1, c_2, \) and \( n_0 \) such that:

\[
c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot g(n) \quad \forall n \geq n_0
\]

#### **Example**
For \( f(n) = 3n^2 + 5n + 7 \):

\[
\Theta(n^2)
\]

## **How Asymptotic Notation Works**
1. **Identify the Most Significant Term**
   - Ignore constants and lower-order terms.
   - Example: \( 4n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n + 1 \) simplifies to \( O(n^3) \).

2. **Classify the Complexity Using Notations**
   - Worst-case: \( O(n^3) \)
   - Best-case: \( \Omega(n^3) \)
   - Tight bound: \( \Theta(n^3) \)

3. **Compare Algorithms Using Growth Rate**
   - \( O(1) \) (constant) â†’ Best  
   - \( O(\log n) \) (logarithmic)  
   - \( O(n) \) (linear)  
   - \( O(n \log n) \)  
   - \( O(n^2) \) (quadratic)  
   - \( O(n^3) \) (cubic)  
   - \( O(2^n) \) (exponential) â†’ Worst

## **Common Time Complexities and Examples**

| Complexity | Name | Example Algorithm |
|------------|---------|--------------------|
| \( O(1) \) | Constant | Accessing an array index |
| \( O(\log n) \) | Logarithmic | Binary search |
| \( O(n) \) | Linear | Linear search |
| \( O(n \log n) \) | Log-linear | Merge sort, Quick sort (average case) |
| \( O(n^2) \) | Quadratic | Bubble sort, Selection sort |
| \( O(n^3) \) | Cubic | Matrix multiplication |
| \( O(2^n) \) | Exponential | Recursive Fibonacci |
| \( O(n!) \) | Factorial | Traveling Salesman Problem |

---

## **Real-World Example**

### **Binary Search: O(log n)**
- Repeatedly divides the problem size by 2.
- Eliminates half the remaining elements.
- Recurrence relation: \( T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) \).
- Simplifies to **O(log n)** complexity.

### **Linear Search: O(n)**
- Scans each element one by one.
- Worst case: searches through all \( n \) elements.
- Time complexity: **O(n)**.

Since **O(log n) < O(n)**, binary search is faster than linear search for large \( n \).
