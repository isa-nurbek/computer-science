# What is Asymptotic Notation?

Asymptotic notation is a mathematical framework used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time complexity and space complexity as the input size (\( n \)) grows. It provides a way to compare algorithms based on their performance without worrying about machine-specific details, such as processor speed or compiler optimizations.

## **Why Asymptotic Notation?**

1. **Focus on Growth Rate** â€“ Instead of considering absolute execution time, we analyze how the runtime scales with increasing input size.
2. **Machine Independence** â€“ It ignores constant factors and lower-order terms that do not significantly impact performance at large \( n \).
3. **Comparative Analysis** â€“ Helps determine which algorithm performs better for large inputs.

## **Types of Asymptotic Notation**

Asymptotic notations describe the upper, lower, and tight bounds of an algorithmâ€™s time complexity.

### **1. Big-O Notation (\( O \)) â€“ Upper Bound**

Big-O notation gives an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm. It describes the worst-case scenario, meaning it tells us the maximum time an algorithm could take.

#### **Mathematical Definition**

A function \( f(n) \) is said to be **O(g(n))** if there exist positive constants \( c \) and \( n_0 \) such that:

\[
f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n) \quad \forall n \geq n_0
\]

#### **Example**

If an algorithm takes \( 3n^2 + 5n + 7 \) operations, we approximate its time complexity as:

\[
O(n^2)
\]

**Why?** Because as \( n \) grows large, the \( n^2 \) term dominates, and constants are ignored.

---

### **2. Omega Notation (\( \Omega \)) â€“ Lower Bound**

Omega notation provides a lower bound on the running time of an algorithm. It describes the best-case scenario, meaning it tells us the minimum time an algorithm will take.

#### **Mathematical Definition**

A function \( f(n) \) is said to be **Î©(g(n))** if there exist positive constants \( c \) and \( n_0 \) such that:

\[
f(n) \geq c \cdot g(n) \quad \forall n \geq n_0
\]

#### **Example**

For the function \( f(n) = 3n^2 + 5n + 7 \), we can say:

\[
\Omega(n^2)
\]

because, in the best case, it still behaves at least as \( n^2 \) for large \( n \).

---

### **3. Theta Notation (\( \Theta \)) â€“ Tight Bound**

Theta notation describes the exact bound of an algorithm, meaning it provides both an upper and a lower bound. It shows the precise order of growth.

#### **Mathematical Definition**

A function \( f(n) \) is said to be **Î˜(g(n))** if there exist positive constants \( c_1, c_2, \) and \( n_0 \) such that:

\[
c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot g(n) \quad \forall n \geq n_0
\]

#### **Example**

For the function \( f(n) = 3n^2 + 5n + 7 \), since its growth rate is bounded both from above and below by \( n^2 \), we write:

\[
\Theta(n^2)
\]

Thus, \( f(n) \) is neither faster nor slower than \( n^2 \) in terms of growth rate.

## **How Asymptotic Notation Works**

To analyze an algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Most Significant Term**  
   - Ignore constants and lower-order terms.
   - Example: \( 4n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n + 1 \) simplifies to \( O(n^3) \).

2. **Classify the Complexity Using Notations**  
   - Worst-case: \( O(n^3) \)
   - Best-case: \( \Omega(n^3) \)
   - Tight bound: \( \Theta(n^3) \)

3. **Compare Algorithms Using Growth Rate**  
   - \( O(1) \) (constant) â†’ Best  
   - \( O(\log n) \) (logarithmic)  
   - \( O(n) \) (linear)  
   - \( O(n \log n) \)  
   - \( O(n^2) \) (quadratic)  
   - \( O(n^3) \) (cubic)  
   - \( O(2^n) \) (exponential) â†’ Worst

## **Common Time Complexities and Examples**

| Complexity | Name | Example Algorithm |
|------------|---------|--------------------|
| \( O(1) \) | Constant | Accessing an array index |
| \( O(\log n) \) | Logarithmic | Binary search |
| \( O(n) \) | Linear | Linear search |
| \( O(n \log n) \) | Log-linear | Merge sort, Quick sort (average case) |
| \( O(n^2) \) | Quadratic | Bubble sort, Selection sort |
| \( O(n^3) \) | Cubic | Matrix multiplication |
| \( O(2^n) \) | Exponential | Recursive Fibonacci |
| \( O(n!) \) | Factorial | Traveling Salesman Problem |

---

## **Real-World Example**

Consider **binary search**:

- It repeatedly divides the problem size by 2.
- At each step, it eliminates half the remaining elements.
- The recurrence relation is: \( T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) \).
- This simplifies to **O(log n)** complexity.

Whereas **linear search**:

- Scans each element one by one.
- Worst case: searches through all \( n \) elements.
- Thus, its time complexity is **O(n)**.

Since **O(log n) < O(n)**, binary search is faster than linear search for large \( n \).
