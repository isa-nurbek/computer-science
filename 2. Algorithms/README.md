# Algorithmic Concepts

This unit explores fundamental algorithmic concepts, including asymptotic notation, recursion, searching algorithms, and dynamic programming. Each topic is accompanied by explanations, examples, and implementations.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Asymptotic Notation

- Understanding Big-O, Big-Θ (Omega), and Big-Ω (Theta)
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Best, worst, and average-case scenarios

### 2. Recursion

- Principles of recursion
- Base case and recursive case
- Tail recursion vs. regular recursion
- Examples: Factorial, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi

### 3. Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)
- Interpolation Search
- Applications and efficiency comparison

### 4. Dynamic Programming

- Memoization vs. Tabulation
- Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
- Examples: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence
