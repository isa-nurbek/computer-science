# Algorithmic Concepts

This unit explores fundamental algorithmic concepts, including asymptotic notation, recursion, searching algorithms, and dynamic programming. Each topic is accompanied by explanations, examples, and implementations.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

### 1. **Asymptotic Notation**

- Understanding Big-O (ÎŸ), Big-Î© (Î©), and Big-Î˜ (Î˜)
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Best-case, worst-case, and average-case scenarios

### 2. **Recursion**

- Principles of recursion
- Base case and recursive case
- Types of recursion (tail, head, tree, etc.)
- Examples: Factorial, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi

### 3. **Searching Algorithms**

- Linear Search
- Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)
- Interpolation Search
- Applications and efficiency comparisons

### 4. **Dynamic Programming**

- Memoization vs. Tabulation
- Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
- Examples: Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence
