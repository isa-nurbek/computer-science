# Linked Lists in Python

Welcome to the **Linked Lists** unit! This unit focuses on understanding, implementing, and using Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists in Python.

## Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

-   Create and use your own `Node` classes in Python.
-   Create and use your own `LinkedList` class in Python using your prior `Node` class.
-   Apply common Linked List algorithms.
-   Create and use your own `DoublyLinkedList` class in Python using an edited version of your prior `Node` class.

## What You Will Learn

1. **Node Class**:

    - Understand the foundational building block of Linked Lists.
    - Learn to implement and utilize a `Node` class in Python.

2. **Singly Linked List**:

    - Explore how to build and manipulate a `LinkedList` class.
    - Practice adding, removing, and searching elements.
    - Understand the traversal and use of common algorithms.

3. **Doubly Linked List**:
    - Learn to modify the `Node` class for Doubly Linked Lists.
    - Implement a `DoublyLinkedList` class to handle bi-directional traversal.
    - Dive into advanced algorithms and applications.

## Getting Started
