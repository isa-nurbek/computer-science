# Linked Lists in Python

Welcome to the **Linked Lists** unit! This unit focuses on understanding, implementing, and using **Singly Linked Lists** and **Doubly Linked Lists** in Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Create and use your own `Node` class in Python.
- Build and manipulate a `LinkedList` class using your custom `Node`.
- Apply common Linked List algorithms.
- Modify the `Node` class and implement a `DoublyLinkedList` class for bi-directional operations.

## ðŸ“˜ What You Will Learn

### 1. **Node Class**

- Understand the foundational building block of linked lists.
- Implement and utilize a `Node` class in Python.

### 2. **Singly Linked List**

- Construct a `LinkedList` class and perform basic operations.
- Practice adding, removing, and searching for elements.
- Traverse the list and apply common algorithms.

### 3. **Doubly Linked List**

- Modify the `Node` class to support previous and next pointers.
- Implement a `DoublyLinkedList` class for bi-directional traversal.
- Explore advanced algorithms and use cases.
