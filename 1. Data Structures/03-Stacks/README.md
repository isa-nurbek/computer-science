# Stacks in Python

Welcome to the **Stacks** unit! This unit explores how stacks work, where they are used, and how to implement them using both Python lists and custom linked list structures.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior of stacks.
- Implement a stack using Python's built-in `list`.
- Build a stack using a linked list-based approach.
- Perform core stack operations such as `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.
- Compare and analyze the performance of each implementation.

## ðŸ“˜ What You Will Learn

### 1. **Stack Fundamentals**

- Understand the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) concept.
- Explore real-world use cases (e.g., undo operations, expression evaluation, recursion stack).

### 2. **Stack Using List**

- Implement a stack using Pythonâ€™s `list`.
- Use `append()` for `push` and `pop()` for `pop`.
- Evaluate the efficiency and simplicity of the built-in list-based approach.

### 3. **Stack Using Linked List**

- Leverage your custom `Node` and `LinkedList` classes.
- Implement `push` (insert at head) and `pop` (remove from head) with O(1) time complexity.
- Structure stack operations cleanly while reinforcing linked list fundamentals.
