# Stacks Data Structure: Conceptual

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It is analogous to a stack of platesâ€”when you add a new plate, it goes on top, and when you take one off, you remove the topmost plate first.

## **1. How a Stack Works**

A stack is typically implemented using:

- **Arrays** (Fixed size, efficient, but requires resizing if full)
- **Linked Lists** (Dynamic size, uses extra memory for pointers)

### **Operations in a Stack**

A stack mainly supports three primary operations:

1. **Push (Insertion)**  
   - Adds an element to the top of the stack.
   - If the stack is full (in a fixed-size array implementation), it results in a "Stack Overflow."

2. **Pop (Deletion)**  
   - Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
   - If the stack is empty, it results in a "Stack Underflow."

3. **Peek (Top or Peek)**  
   - Returns the top element without removing it.

Additional operations:

- **isEmpty()** â€“ Checks if the stack is empty.
- **isFull()** â€“ Checks if the stack is full (for array-based stacks).
- **Size()** â€“ Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## **2. Stack Representation**

A stack can be represented as:

```text
Stack:
Top â†’  [  5  ]
         [  8  ]
         [  3  ]
Bottom â†’ [  1  ]
```

- If we perform `pop()`, the element `5` is removed.
- If we perform `push(10)`, it gets placed on top.

## **3. Applications of Stacks**

Stacks are used in various real-world and computer science applications, including:

### **1. Function Calls (Recursion)**

- The call stack manages function calls in programming.
- When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack.
- When it finishes execution, it is popped.

### **2. Undo/Redo Operations**

- Applications like text editors store actions in a stack to enable undo/redo functionality.

### **3. Expression Evaluation (Postfix/Infix/Prefix)**

- Stacks are used to evaluate and convert expressions (e.g., infix to postfix notation).

### **4. Backtracking Algorithms**

- Used in solving maze problems, depth-first search (DFS), and pathfinding.

### **5. Browser History**

- Back and forward operations in a web browser use stacks.

## **4. Stack vs. Queue**

| Feature        | Stack (LIFO)  | Queue (FIFO)  |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Order        | Last In, First Out | First In, First Out |
| Insert (Push/Enqueue) | At the top | At the rear |
| Remove (Pop/Dequeue) | From the top | From the front |
| Example Use  | Function calls, undo-redo | Task scheduling, print queue |

### **Conclusion**

Stacks are an essential data structure widely used in software development and system operations. Understanding their LIFO behavior and applications will help in writing efficient algorithms, especially when dealing with recursive functions, expression evaluations, and backtracking problems.
