## Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Let's analyze the **time and space complexity** of the given **Queue** implementation.

### 1. **Time Complexity**

Each operation's time complexity:

- **`enqueue(data)`**:  
  - Creating a new node takes **O(1)**.  
  - Updating the `rear` pointer and linking takes **O(1)**.  
  - **Overall complexity: O(1)**.

- **`dequeue()`**:  
  - Checking if the queue is empty takes **O(1)**.  
  - Removing the front node and updating the pointers takes **O(1)**.  
  - **Overall complexity: O(1)**.

- **`peek()`**:  
  - Checking if the queue is empty takes **O(1)**.  
  - Returning the front element takes **O(1)**.  
  - **Overall complexity: O(1)**.

- **`__str__()` (Printing the queue)**:  
  - Traverses all nodes in the queue, taking **O(n)** time, where **n** is the number of elements in the queue.

### 2. **Space Complexity**
- Each element in the queue is stored in a **Node** object, which requires **O(n)** space for **n** elements.
- No additional auxiliary space is used apart from a few pointers (`front` and `rear`), which are **O(1)**.
- **Overall space complexity: O(n)**.

This is an efficient **linked list-based queue**, performing enqueue, dequeue, and peek in constant time. ðŸš€

# ********************************************************************************************************************* #

# Code Explanation:

"""
The provided code defines a simple **Queue** data structure using a **singly linked list**. Below is a detailed
explanation of how the code works, broken down into its components:

---

### 1. **Node Class**
```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```
- The `Node` class represents a single node in the linked list.
- Each node has two attributes:
  - `data`: Stores the value of the node.
  - `next`: A pointer to the next node in the list. Initially, it is set to `None`.

---

### 2. **Queue Class**
The `Queue` class implements the queue data structure using the `Node` class. A queue follows the 
**First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed.

#### Attributes:
- `front`: A pointer to the first node in the queue (the node to be dequeued next).
- `rear`: A pointer to the last node in the queue (the node most recently enqueued).

#### Methods:

##### a. **`__init__` (Constructor)**
```
def __init__(self):
    self.front = None
    self.rear = None
```
- Initializes an empty queue by setting both `front` and `rear` to `None`.

---

##### b. **`is_empty`**
```
def is_empty(self):
    return self.front is None
```
- Checks if the queue is empty by verifying if `front` is `None`.
- Returns `True` if the queue is empty, otherwise `False`.

---

##### c. **`enqueue`**
```
def enqueue(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if self.rear is None:
        self.front = self.rear = new_node
        return
    self.rear.next = new_node
    self.rear = new_node
```
- Adds a new node to the end of the queue.
- Steps:
  1. Create a new node with the given `data`.
  2. If the queue is empty (`rear` is `None`), set both `front` and `rear` to the new node.
  3. If the queue is not empty:
     - Link the current `rear` node's `next` pointer to the new node.
     - Update `rear` to point to the new node.

---

##### d. **`dequeue`**
```
def dequeue(self):
    if self.is_empty():
        raise IndexError("Dequeue from an empty queue")
    temp = self.front
    self.front = temp.next
    if self.front is None:
        self.rear = None
    return temp.data
```
- Removes and returns the node at the front of the queue.
- Steps:
  1. Check if the queue is empty. If it is, raise an `IndexError`.
  2. Store the current `front` node in a temporary variable `temp`.
  3. Move the `front` pointer to the next node in the queue.
  4. If the queue becomes empty after dequeueing (`front` is `None`), set `rear` to `None`.
  5. Return the `data` of the dequeued node.

---

##### e. **`peek`**
```
def peek(self):
    if self.is_empty():
        raise IndexError("Peek from an empty queue")
    return self.front.data
```
- Returns the `data` of the node at the front of the queue without removing it.
- If the queue is empty, raises an `IndexError`.

---

##### f. **`__str__`**
```
def __str__(self):
    if self.is_empty():
        return "Queue is empty"
    temp = self.front
    queue_str = []
    while temp:
        queue_str.append(str(temp.data))
        temp = temp.next
    return " -> ".join(queue_str)
```
- Provides a string representation of the queue.
- Steps:
  1. If the queue is empty, return `"Queue is empty"`.
  2. Otherwise, traverse the queue from `front` to `rear`, appending each node's `data` to a list.
  3. Join the list elements with `" -> "` to represent the queue as a string.

---

### 3. **Example Usage**
```
queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(10)
queue.enqueue(20)
queue.enqueue(30)

print("Queue:", queue)  # Output: Queue: 10 -> 20 -> 30

print("Dequeue:", queue.dequeue())  # Output: Dequeue: 10

print("Queue after dequeue:", queue)  # Output: Queue after dequeue: 20 -> 30

print("Peek:", queue.peek())  # Output: Peek: 20
```
- **Step-by-Step Execution:**
  1. Create an empty queue.
  2. Enqueue `10`, `20`, and `30` into the queue. The queue now looks like: `10 -> 20 -> 30`.
  3. Print the queue: `Queue: 10 -> 20 -> 30`.
  4. Dequeue the front element (`10`). The queue now looks like: `20 -> 30`.
  5. Print the queue after dequeue: `Queue after dequeue: 20 -> 30`.
  6. Peek at the front element (`20`) without removing it.

---

### 4. **Key Points**
- The queue is implemented using a singly linked list, where `front` points to the first node and `rear` points to the last node.
- Enqueueing adds a node to the `rear`, and dequeueing removes a node from the `front`.
- The `__str__` method provides a visual representation of the queue.
- The `is_empty` method is used to handle edge cases (e.g., dequeueing or peeking from an empty queue).

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the FIFO principle of a queue.
