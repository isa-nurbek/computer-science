# Queues in Python

Welcome to the **Queues** unit! This unit is all about understanding how Queues work, their key operations, and how to implement them efficiently using both Python lists and linked lists.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle of queues.
- Implement a Queue using Python's built-in `list`.
- Build a Queue using a custom `LinkedList`-based approach.
- Perform standard queue operations like `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `peek`.
- Recognize the performance differences between implementations.

## ðŸ“˜ What You Will Learn

### 1. **Queue Fundamentals**

- Understand the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) behavior.
- Learn real-world applications of queues (e.g., print queues, task scheduling, etc.).

### 2. **Queue Using List**

- Implement a queue using Pythonâ€™s built-in `list`.
- Explore how `append()` and `pop(0)` work for enqueuing and dequeuing.
- Analyze the time complexity and performance concerns of list-based queues.

### 3. **Queue Using Linked List**

- Reuse your custom `Node` and `LinkedList` classes.
- Implement `enqueue` (add to tail) and `dequeue` (remove from head) operations efficiently.
- Practice writing clean and modular queue code with O(1) operations.
