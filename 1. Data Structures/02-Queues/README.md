# Queues in Python

Welcome to the **Queues** unit! This unit focuses on understanding, implementing, and using **Queues** and **Dequeues** in Python using both classes and built-in modules.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle of Queues.
- Create and use your own `Queue` class in Python.
- Use Python's built-in `collections.deque` module.
- Implement and manipulate a `Deque` (Double-Ended Queue).
- Apply common queue operations and algorithms.

## ðŸ“˜ What You Will Learn

### 1. **Queue Basics**

- Understand how queues work in computer science.
- Explore real-life examples of queues (e.g., waiting lines, task scheduling).

### 2. **Implementing a Queue (Class-Based)**

- Build a `Queue` class using a list or linked list.
- Learn and implement `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, and `is_empty` methods.

### 3. **Using `collections.deque`**

- Learn to use Python's efficient built-in `deque` from the `collections` module.
- Perform fast append and pop operations from both ends.

### 4. **Implementing a Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**

- Understand the difference between a queue and a deque.
- Implement or use a `Deque` that supports insertion and deletion from both ends.

### 5. **Common Queue Applications**

- Task scheduling
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Caching and buffering systems
