# Hash Maps in Python

Welcome to the **Hash Maps** unit! This unit is designed to help you understand how hash maps (also known as hash tables or dictionaries) work in Python and how to implement your own from scratch.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts behind hashing and hash maps.
- Create your own `HashMap` class in Python.
- Handle collisions using common techniques like chaining and linear probing.
- Apply hash maps in solving real-world problems efficiently.

## ðŸ“˜ What You Will Learn

### 1. **Introduction to Hash Maps**

- Understand what a hash map is and why it's useful.
- Learn about keys, values, and how hashing works.
- Explore Pythonâ€™s built-in `dict` and its efficiency.

### 2. **Building a HashMap from Scratch**

- Implement a custom `HashMap` class.
- Write your own hashing function.
- Store key-value pairs using arrays (buckets).

### 3. **Collision Handling**

- Learn about the types of collisions and why they occur.
- Implement **separate chaining** using linked lists.
- Explore **open addressing** with **linear probing** or **quadratic probing**.

### 4. **Common Operations**

- Add, retrieve, and remove key-value pairs.
- Resize the hash map to maintain performance.
- Analyze time and space complexity.

### 5. **Practical Applications**

- Use hash maps to solve common coding problems:
  - Frequency counting
  - Detecting duplicates
  - Caching
  - Implementing sets, etc.
